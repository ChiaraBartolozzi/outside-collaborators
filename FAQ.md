1. **Why sticking to GitHub Actions instead of using GitHub Apps?**

    >[GitHub Apps][1] come with lots of advantages over GitHub Actions (e.g. they are not ephemeral, they use their own
    identity without the need for maintaing bots as separate users...) but are applications that you have to host
    somewhere. Unless eager developers out there will turn this automation into a GitHub App freely available in the
    [marketplace][2] 😉, we deem much more convenient to spare the burden of maitaining a local server and offload
    the service to the GitHub runners.
